# The New York Philharmonic Performance History
Since its first concert on December 7, 1842, the New York Philharmonic has been keeping records of all its performances which now add up to almost 16,000. Each concert has been cataloged in the Philharmonic's [Performance History database](http://archives.nyphil.org/performancehistory) in great detail. The [Leon Levy Digital Archives](http://archives.nyphil.org), provides an additional interface for searching performances alongside other digitized items such as marked music scores, marked orchestral parts, business records, and photos.

In an effort to make this data available for study, analysis, and reuse, the Philharmonic joins organizations like the [Tate](https://github.com/tategallery/collection) and the <a href="http://www.cooperhewitt.org/">Cooper Hewitt</a> in making its own contribution to the Open Data movement.
